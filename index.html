        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Apoorva Prakash and I’m a third year Computer Science and Economics major, running to be one of your next ASUC* Senators! 
        </p>
        <p>
            As a woman in STEM, I don’t find our STEM communities to be inclusive to womxn and underrepresented students. I am upset that we don’t treat menstrual products as a fundamental right on this campus, though a majority of our campus menstruates. And while I am blessed to have found a home in so many communities on this campus (the pre-law community*, the Greek community*, the dance community*, amongst others), I know we can improve risk practices in our RSOs. With that being said, I want to inspire change on our campus through my campaign and as an ASUC* Senator!
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m running with the Rebuild coalition: you can read more about Rebuild’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Rebuildcoalition2020/photos/rpp.105536521064454/105672701050836/">mission statement here</a>.

            <h1>PLATFORMS</h1>
            <h2>MENSTRUAL EQUITY</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Insisting on free menstrual products in ALL bathrooms on campus 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Menstrual products are absolutely essential for our students. Not having guaranteed access to menstrual products while on campus makes it so much harder for students to focus on their education!
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Of course, not all who menstruate are womxn! We need to be as inclusive as possible while providing basic needs to all students. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li> Identifying menstrual products as a basic need and human right for all students 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If we can expect toilet paper and paper towels in our bathrooms, there’s no reason we shouldn’t safely be able to expect menstrual products as well. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is important we acknowledge global period poverty, and realize that this affects students on our campus as well.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Supporting organizations uplifting reproductive justice on campus and beyond
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h2>SUPPORTING WOMXN IN STEM/TECH</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Facilitating womxn-focused networking opportunities within STEM/Tech fields
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Corporate America largely disadvantages womxn, which means that recruiting/career events can be stressful for womxn students, particularly in STEM fields where such career fairs are crucial. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Drawing inspiration from conferences like Grace Hopper*, which advocate for diverse hiring and uplifting womxn in STEM, organizing similar opportunities for UC* Berkeley students would help womxn students overcome the inherent biases that hinder their careers.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                <li> Supporting STEM/Tech RSOs in striving towards gender parity in their membership and leadership
                    <ul>
                        Gender demographics of STEM/Tech student organizations on campus should reflect the demographic of all students in STEM/Tech.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        Officer boards of tech organizations are overwhelmingly made up of male-identifying students, which seems statistically unlikely without gender bias in officer selections.
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                <li> Advising STEM/Tech RSOs recruitment and retention efforts to be more womxn-inclusive
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            STEM/Tech RSOs should be encouraged to introduce initiatives to help and empower their womxn members. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Members of STEM/Tech RSOs should understand and acknowledge the biases facing womxn in their field, and make tangible efforts to overcome them.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>HIGHER RISK STANDARDS FOR RSOs
                </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Creating standardized risk education curriculum as a resource for RSOs
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            While ASUC* directly manages RSOs and their funding, their risk requirements on RSOs are weak and not enforced. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In recent years, UC Berkeley* RSOs have had many bad risk incidents, including incidents of sexual violence and discrimination.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Developing educational resources for student organizations in topics that affect all our students is crucial, as it is essential for all UC Berkeley* standards to maintain high standards of risk management. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                <li> Mandating that all RSOs undergo risk management training in various topics, such as alcohol/drugs, SVSH, mental health, and hazing
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        Restructuring the training that students are required to do before becoming signatories of RSOs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Creating risk workshops for all students, and providing resources for RSOs to facilitate their own risk workshops, whether internal or external.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Incentivizing and enforcing that RSOs require all members to learn about risk management and adopt better risk practices.  
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                <li> Incentivizing better risk practices at RSO events
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Advocating for consent talks at social events, reducing the stigma behind discussing sexual violence preventaion. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Encouraging our RSOs to adopt more sustainable practices as well. 
                        </li>

Being “a proactive ally and accomplice to marginalized campus communities” and representing those who are underrepresented is not only a goal of my campaign, but of my life as a whole. Making the UC system* more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable are fundamental goals of my campaign.

            I’m very proud to be part of a coalition of talented and passionate candidates, whose principles and values reflect my own. I am committed to REBUILD’s mission statement and I will continue to fight for these tenets throughout my campaign.
